# AI for Terahertz Metasurface Sensing
This is the code repository accompanying the paper "DeepSeek-Motivated AI Physics Exploration: Mining Accidental BICs in Metasurfaces for Terahertz Sensing".

##  Model Training

The AI models in this project were trained locally using **Python 3.9**, the open-source deep learning framework **PyTorch 1.12.1**, and **CUDA 11.6**. The training and execution were conducted on a computer with the following hardware and system specifications:

- **Operating System**: Windows 11  
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060Ti  
- **CPU**: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10700K @ 2.90 GHz  
- **RAM**: 16 GB  

##  Running the Project

* To launch the GUI tool located in the `prediction_tools` folder, please install the required dependency `pyqt5`.
* To avoid potential path-related issues, it is strongly recommended to place the entire project directory under `D:\DL\` .

##  Data Access

* Due to the large size of the `data_space` folder, it is not included in the GitHub repository.
* The `data_space` can be accessed via [Google Drive Download Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10HxPnLU55VS_4dcNoTHQ1NRpp_2NSZ3a/view?usp=sharing).
